        India is a country of rich heritage with abundant culture, flavours and
        cuisines. Yet it is grappling with a serious issue that impacts nearly
        23 crore people living in the country – Food Wastage in India. The
        Ministry of Agriculture, India reported that nearly 50,000 INR crores
        worth of food gets wasted each year. This alarming amount of food that
        is getting wasted every single day in a country where millions of people
        still go to bed hungry each night is an appalling reality that demands
        our immediate attention and action. Come with us to know the food
        wastage facts in India.

        According to the UNEP’s (United Nations Environment Programme) food
        wastage index report, 68.7 million tonnes of food is wasted annually in
        Indian homes, in simple words it is about 55 kgs per person. It stands
        2nd worldwide in terms of household wastage of food only followed by
        China. A report by the National Resources Defence Council (NDRC) says
        that 40% of the food produced goes uneaten in the US, whereas in Asia,
        approx 1.34 billion tonnes of food gets wasted; the main contributors
        being India and China. The FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of
        India) reported that 1/3rd of all food produced in India gets wasted or
        spoilt before it is even eaten. This is a very serious concern as it
        comes to show that people not only waste the food deliberately but
        aren’t even aware of it.
